# Lua Function: Return Smaller Number

This repository demonstrates a simple Lua function that returns the smaller of two numbers and how to improve its clarity and handling of edge cases.

## Bug Description
The original function lacked clarity and did not explicitly handle cases where the inputs might be equal. This could lead to unexpected behavior or confusion for those reading the code.

## Bug Solution
The improved function clearly indicates that it returns the smaller of two numbers and handles the edge case where the inputs are equal. The added comments enhance readability and maintainability.

## How to Run
1. Save the `bug.lua` file (original buggy code) and the `bugSolution.lua` file (improved solution) in the same directory.
2. Open a Lua interpreter and execute each file separately.  You can use the command line with `lua bug.lua` and `lua bugSolution.lua`.

Observe the outputs from each version and compare the differences to understand the bug and the fix.
